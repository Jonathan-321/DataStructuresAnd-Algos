In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was with God in the beginning. Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made. In him was life, and that life was the light of all mankind. The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.

There was a man sent from God whose name was John. He came as a witness to testify concerning that light, so that through him all might believe. He himself was not the light; he came only as a witness to the light.

The true light that gives light to everyone was coming into the world. He was in the world, and though the world was made through him, the world did not recognize him. He came to that which was his own, but his own did not receive him. Yet to all who did receive him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of Godâ€” children born not of natural descent, nor of human decision or a husbandâ€™s will, but born of God.

The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the one and only Son, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth.

(John testified concerning him. He cried out, saying, â€œThis is the one I spoke about when I said, â€˜He who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me.â€™â€) Out of his fullness we have all received grace in place of grace already given. For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. No one has ever seen God, but the one and only Son, who is himself God and is in closest relationship with the Father, has made him known.

Now this was Johnâ€™s testimony when the Jewish leaders in Jerusalem sent priests and Levites to ask him who he was. He did not fail to confess, but confessed freely, â€œI am not the Messiah.â€

They asked him, â€œThen who are you? Are you Elijah?â€

He said, â€œI am not.â€

â€œAre you the Prophet?â€

He answered, â€œNo.â€

Finally they said, â€œWho are you? Give us an answer to take back to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?â€

John replied in the words of Isaiah the prophet, â€œI am the voice of one calling in the wilderness, â€˜Make straight the way for the Lord.â€™â€

Now the Pharisees who had been sent questioned him, â€œWhy then do you baptize if you are not the Messiah, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?â€

â€œI baptize with water,â€ John replied, â€œbut among you stands one you do not know. He is the one who comes after me, the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie.â€

This all happened at Bethany on the other side of the Jordan, where John was baptizing.

The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said, â€œLook, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world! This is the one I meant when I said, â€˜A man who comes after me has surpassed me because he was before me.â€™ I myself did not know him, but the reason I came baptizing with water was that he might be revealed to Israel.â€

Then John gave this testimony: â€œI saw the Spirit come down from heaven as a dove and remain on him. And I myself did not know him, but the one who sent me to baptize with water told me, â€˜The man on whom you see the Spirit come down and remain is the one who will baptize with the Holy Spirit.â€™ I have seen and I testify that this is Godâ€™s Chosen One.â€

The next day John was there again with two of his disciples. When he saw Jesus passing by, he said, â€œLook, the Lamb of God!â€

When the two disciples heard him say this, they followed Jesus. Turning around, Jesus saw them following and asked, â€œWhat do you want?â€

They said, â€œRabbiâ€ (which means â€œTeacherâ€), â€œwhere are you staying?â€

â€œCome,â€ he replied, â€œand you will see.â€

So they went and saw where he was staying, and they spent that day with him. It was about four in the afternoon.

Andrew, Simon Peterâ€™s brother, was one of the two who heard what John had said and who had followed Jesus. The first thing Andrew did was to find his brother Simon and tell him, â€œWe have found the Messiahâ€ (that is, the Christ). And he brought him to Jesus.

Jesus looked at him and said, â€œYou are Simon son of John. You will be called Cephasâ€ (which, when translated, is Peter).

The next day Jesus decided to leave for Galilee. Finding Philip, he said to him, â€œFollow me.â€

Philip, like Andrew and Peter, was from the town of Bethsaida. Philip found Nathanael and told him, â€œWe have found the one Moses wrote about in the Law, and about whom the prophets also wroteâ€”Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.â€

â€œNazareth! Can anything good come from there?â€ Nathanael asked.

â€œCome and see,â€ said Philip.

When Jesus saw Nathanael approaching, he said of him, â€œHere truly is an Israelite in whom there is no deceit.â€

â€œHow do you know me?â€ Nathanael asked.

Jesus answered, â€œI saw you while you were still under the fig tree before Philip called you.â€

Then Nathanael declared, â€œRabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the king of Israel.â€

Jesus said, â€œYou believe because I told you I saw you under the fig tree. You will see greater things than that.â€ He then added, â€œVery truly I tell you, you will see â€˜heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending onâ€™ the Son of Man.â€
